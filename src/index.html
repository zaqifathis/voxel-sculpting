        <br>
        <p>Voxel Sculpting is a prototype for fast and interactive
            design modeling. By having a block of Tower as a given geometry,
            the designer could do the most basic design strategy, sculpting,
            by removing each voxel using click-button driven by your own
            imagination. </p>
